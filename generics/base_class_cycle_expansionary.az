// This test shows that with a cycle, you could produce a type with an "infinite" number of
// supertypes. Consider the full list of supertypes of `C[T]`. It contains `C[C[T]]`, therefore it
// contains `C[C[CT]]` and so on.

public class A[T] inherits C[C[T]] { } // ERROR cycle in supertype

public class B[T] inherits A[T] { } // ERROR cycle in supertype

public class C[T] inherits B[T] { } // ERROR cycle in supertype

public class Tail inherits C[Tail] { }
